# Phase 2 — Processing

## Summary
Turns each `ParsedFiling` (Phase 1 output) into a list of `Chunk` objects ready for embedding. Cleans residual Unicode/boilerplate noise, serializes raw HTML tables into markdown + natural-language sentences, splits section/table text via a configurable strategy (fixed/recursive/semantic/sentence_window/parent_child), and stamps filing+section identity onto every chunk. Output lands at `data/processed/{ticker}/{form}_{year}/chunks.json` — this is what Phase 3 (Indexing) embeds into Qdrant.

## Files Changed / Added
- `src/processing/models.py` — new — `Chunk`, `ChunkMetadata`, `ChunkStrategy` literal
- `src/processing/cleaner.py` — modified (stub → full) — `TextCleaner`: Unicode normalization, stray "Table of Contents" removal, whitespace collapse
- `src/processing/table_serializer.py` — modified (stub → full) — `TableSerializer`: raw HTML `<table>` → markdown + row-wise NL sentences
- `src/processing/chunkers.py` — modified (stub → full) — `chunk_fixed`, `chunk_recursive`, `chunk_sentence_window`, `chunk_parent_child`, `chunk_semantic`, `chunk_text()` dispatcher
- `src/processing/enricher.py` — modified (stub → full) — `enrich()`: stamps `ChunkMetadata` onto chunks
- `scripts/process_filings.py` — new — CLI: `parsed.json` → clean → chunk → enrich → `chunks.json`
- `configs/base.yaml` — modified — added `chunking.sentence_window_size`, `chunking.semantic_similarity_threshold`, `chunking.parent_chunk_size`, `chunking.child_chunk_size`
- `tests/unit/test_chunkers.py` — new (filled stub) — all 5 strategies + dispatcher
- `tests/unit/test_cleaner.py` — new
- `tests/unit/test_table_serializer.py` — new
- `tests/unit/test_enricher.py` — new
- `notebooks/02_chunking_experiments.ipynb` — modified (stub → full, executed) — runs `TextCleaner`, `TableSerializer`, and all chunking strategies against real AAPL 10-K 2023 data; compares chunk count/size per strategy; justifies `recursive` default

## Key Design Decisions
- **Cleaner is narrow in scope**: `html_parser.py` (Phase 1) already collapses all whitespace to single spaces and strips the ToC block via its gap heuristic. Cleaner only handles what survives that: Unicode quote/dash normalization, stray inline "Table of Contents" cross-references. Deliberately does NOT strip standalone page-number digits — once text is flattened to single-line, a digit run is indistinguishable from a real dollar figure; a false-positive strip would silently corrupt financial data.
- **Raw tables become synthetic sections, not a separate code path**: `ParsedFiling.raw_tables` is filing-level, not tied to an Item section. `process_filings.py` wraps each serialized table as a `ParsedSection(item_label="Table N", ...)` so it flows through the exact same `chunk_text()` + `enrich()` pipeline as prose — no parallel table-chunking logic.
- **Table serializer keeps empty cells, only drops fully-blank rows**: first attempt dropped empty `<td>` cells as "padding," which shifted later cells left and broke the header→value column alignment used to build NL sentences (caught by `test_table_serializer.py` failing during implementation). Fixed by keeping cell positions intact; a blank corner cell above the row-label column is structurally meaningful, not padding.
- **Table serializer emits both markdown and NL sentences**: markdown preserves row/column structure for the LLM at generation time; NL sentences ("Net sales (2023): $383,285") exist because BGE-M3 was never trained to treat pipe-delimited syntax as semantically equivalent to prose — dense retrieval against natural-language financial questions matches sentences far better.
- **Sentence splitting via regex, not nltk/spacy**: `_SENTENCE_SPLIT_RE` (punctuation + whitespace + capital/quote/paren lookahead) is good enough for 10-K/10-Q prose and avoids a new dependency just for `sentence_window`/`semantic` strategies.
- **`chunk_text()` token_count is a word-count proxy, not a real tokenizer**: no tokenizer dependency wired in yet — Phase 3's embedding model does real tokenization at encode time. This field is only for chunk-size sanity logging.
- **Semantic chunker lazy-loads BGE-M3 via a module-level singleton** (`_get_embedder`): avoids the ~2.3GB download/init cost for every other strategy. Tests monkeypatch `_get_embedder` with a fake returning hand-picked vectors — never touches the real model, keeps tests offline/fast.
- **Parent-child indexes children, fetches parents at generation time**: small chunks (`child_chunk_size`) embed precisely for retrieval match; large chunks (`parent_chunk_size`) carry context but dilute embeddings. `is_parent=True` chunks are not meant to be vector-indexed in Phase 3 — looked up by `parent_id` instead.
- **Sentence_window splits `text` (embedded) from `context_text` (shown to LLM)**: embedding a single sentence gets a tight match; `context_text` (±N sentences) is what generation actually reads. Keeping them separate fields prevents diluting embedding precision.
- **`chunk_text(text, cfg)` takes the whole DictConfig, not unpacked args**: each strategy needs a different subset of `chunking.*` keys — centralizing the unpacking means `process_filings.py` doesn't need to know which keys matter for which strategy.
- **`enrich()` is a separate step from chunking, mutates in place**: keeps `chunkers.py` a pure text-in/chunks-out module, testable without constructing a `ParsedFiling`. `enrich()` returns the same list object (mutated), matching the cheap in-place pattern used throughout this phase.

## Execution Flow
1. `python scripts/process_filings.py --ticker AAPL --years 2023` (or no args → config defaults)
2. `load_config()` resolves `configs/base.yaml`
3. `_find_parsed_filings()` scans `data/processed/{ticker}/{form}_{year}/` for `parsed.json` (written by Phase 1's `parse_filings.py`); skips if `chunks.json` already exists (idempotent)
4. per filing, `chunk_filing(filing, cfg, cleaner, serializer)`:
   a. for each `ParsedSection` in `filing.sections`: `TextCleaner.clean(section.text)` → if non-empty, `chunk_text(cleaned, cfg)` dispatches to the configured strategy → `enrich(chunks, filing, section)` stamps `ChunkMetadata`
   b. `TableSerializer.serialize_all(filing.raw_tables)` → each serialized table wrapped as a synthetic `ParsedSection(item_label="Table N")` → same `chunk_text()` + `enrich()` path
   c. all chunks from (a) and (b) concatenated into one list
5. writes `data/processed/{ticker}/{form}_{year}/chunks.json` (`[c.model_dump(mode="json") for c in chunks]`)
6. CLI prints rich summary table (ticker/form/year/strategy/chunk count/status)

### Strategy dispatch detail (`chunk_text`)
- `fixed` → `chunk_fixed()`: char windows of `chunk_size` with `chunk_overlap` step
- `recursive` → `chunk_recursive()`: wraps `langchain_text_splitters.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with config `separators`
- `sentence_window` → `chunk_sentence_window()`: one chunk per sentence, `context_text` = ±`sentence_window_size` neighbors
- `parent_child` → `chunk_parent_child()`: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at `parent_chunk_size`, then each parent re-split at `child_chunk_size`; children carry `parent_id`
- `semantic` → `chunk_semantic()`: sentences embedded via lazy-loaded BGE-M3, consecutive sentences grouped while cosine similarity ≥ `semantic_similarity_threshold` and group length < `chunk_size`

## Data Contract (Input → Output)
- Input (from Phase 1): `data/processed/{ticker}/{form}_{year}/parsed.json` — `ParsedFiling` model
- Output (consumed by Phase 3): `data/processed/{ticker}/{form}_{year}/chunks.json` — `list[Chunk]`, each with `text`, `strategy`, `chunk_index`, `token_count`, `parent_id`/`is_parent` (parent_child only), `context_text` (sentence_window only), `metadata: ChunkMetadata` (ticker/cik/form/fiscal_year/company_name/item_label/section_title)

## Tests
- `tests/unit/test_chunkers.py` — fixed (size/overlap, empty input), recursive (paragraph/sentence splitting), sentence_window (context window clamping at boundaries), parent_child (parent_id linkage), semantic (similarity-based grouping + single-sentence short-circuit, both via fake embedder), `chunk_text()` dispatch + unknown-strategy error
- `tests/unit/test_cleaner.py` — empty input, Unicode normalization, ToC removal, whitespace collapse, dollar-figure preservation
- `tests/unit/test_table_serializer.py` — markdown output, NL sentence output, empty/single-row table handling, `serialize_all` dropping unparseable tables
- `tests/unit/test_enricher.py` — metadata stamped correctly onto every chunk, in-place mutation (same list object returned)
- Full suite: 35 passed (`python -m pytest tests/unit -q`)
- Gap: no test runs the real BGE-M3 model (by design — fake embedder substitutes it); no test exercises `process_filings.py`'s file-finding/caching logic against real `parsed.json` fixtures on disk

## Config Keys Used
- `configs/base.yaml` → `chunking.strategy`, `chunking.chunk_size`, `chunking.chunk_overlap`, `chunking.separators`, `chunking.sentence_window_size`, `chunking.semantic_similarity_threshold`, `chunking.parent_chunk_size`, `chunking.child_chunk_size`, `embeddings.dense_model` (semantic strategy only)

## Open Items / Deferred
- `src/pipeline.py` left as a stub — full end-to-end wiring deferred until Phase 3-6 (indexing/retrieval/generation) exist; wiring it now against unbuilt phases would be speculative
- Token counting is a word-count proxy, not a real tokenizer — acceptable since Phase 3's embedder does real tokenization; revisit only if exact token budgets become necessary
- Table serializer's NL-sentence heuristic assumes label-in-column-0 + period-headers-in-row-0 — holds for every EDGAR table structure seen so far, not guaranteed by spec
